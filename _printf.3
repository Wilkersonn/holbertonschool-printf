.TH _PRINTF 3 "July 2024" "Version 1.0" "Custom C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
_printf \- format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <main.h>
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. It writes under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion specifier.
.PP
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B %d, %i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation.
.TP
.B %o
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal notation.
.TP
.B %x, %X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned hexadecimal notation.
.TP
.B %f
The double argument is converted to decimal notation.
.TP
.B %c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B %s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
.TP
.B %%
A '%' is written. No argument is converted.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of how to use
.BR _printf() :
.PP
.nf
.RS
_printf("Hello, %s!\\n", "world");
_printf("The answer is %d\\n", 42);
_printf("Hex: %x, Octal: %o\\n", 255, 255);
